        <h1>Letter to Tiffani Vuong</h1>
        <p id="text1">By now you probably have already figured out that someone from the SEA Admit program has contacted me (and most likely Brendon, mom, and dad) to write you a letter to motivate you for your SEA Admit program. Obviously you wouldn't expect one from me because that's not really the kinds of stuff we do/talk about so instead I made this website with a very important message at the bottom. Also, I somehow don't think mom and dad are tech savy enough to send Angela a letter so it would be kind of awkward if you didn't get anything from your family (but I could be wrong). Anyway, originally I was going to type up a letter to send to you, but there was no sort of security to prevent other people from reading it so I decided not to. Instead I created this simple website to add a sequrity question that made sure only you can see this (unless someone asked you this specific question to try and break through the sequrity question or if they just looked at the code for the webpage since it has the answer). If you are wondering why the wensite is so boring and plan, it is because I do not care enough to style it lol and because I thought this was due today, but it's actually due on Tuesday and I'm too lazy to change/add anything. I'm trying to makes this long so it looks like I hvae something to say, but I am running out of ideas to talk about so I will just have to type the secret message I didn't want anyone to read. By now, you may already know what it is but I will type it anyway. The secret message is... </p>
